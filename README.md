# Description

### I 've taken this relatively small project to refresh my core skills in my stack (HTML,CSS,JS) and then modified the code with react .

## Technologies used

---

1. HTML5
2. Css3 modules
3. Javascript (ES6)
4. React without redux or context

## Details

---

This project is part of the crash course provided by _Jonas shmedtmann_ .

I did not stick to his instructions but I make use of this chance to challenge my self in applying my knowlege and leverage my skills.

This is obvious in the difference in the approach between my code and his(_splitting the components into separate files as an example_)

I added also a nice Loading spinner as a **re-usable component**

## Features

---

- [x] adding new fact in the form.
- [x] selecting specific category from all facts.
- [ ] adding votes (_not fully handled in the backend_).
- [ ] adding authentication.
